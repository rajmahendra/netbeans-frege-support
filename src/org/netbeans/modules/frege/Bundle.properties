OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    Frege is a pure functional programming language for the JVM in the spirit of Haskell. \
    It enjoys a strong static type system with powerful type inference and non-strict - also known as lazy - evaluation.\n\n\
    Frege programs are compiled to Java and run on the JVM.\n\n\
    The similarity to Haskell is actually strong enough that many users call it "a Haskell for the JVM".
